## Projects

### TikTok AI Character Integration
#### Description:

- Developed an AI-driven TikTok character, "Perch Perkins," integrating OpenAI and ElevenLabs APIs for live interactions.
- Automated real-time text-to-speech responses and chat engagement using Python and Tikfinity scripts.
- Achievements: Gained 40,000 followers and $50+ in gifts within the first week.

#### Technologies Used:

- Python
- APIs: OpenAI, ElevenLabs
- Tools: Tikfinity, Text-to-Speech Systems

#### Key Files:

- PerchPerkinsScript.py - Main script for live chat integration.
    - Sensitive components such as API keys and audio files have been removed to protect the integrity of the project. For a full demonstration, please contact me using the information below.

#### Future Plans

- Fine tune and get the openai api connection fully working
- Learn Tiktok's actual api and convert the script to use Tiktok's python package instead of using a third party event handler like Tikfinity
- Create new characters that can be used on multiple accounts to scale its reach



### IMDB Movie Recommendation

#### Description
- Built a collaborative filtering-based recommendation engine for movie preferences using Python.
- Combined multiple IMDB datasets and personal ratings into a scalable data frame, enabling adaptability for broader users.
- Implemented models including neural networks and XGBoost, achieving a 15% improvement in accuracy.

#### Technologies Used

- Python (pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn)
- Machine Learning Models: Neural Networks, XGBoost, SVR Regressors, LassoCV, Random Forest Regressors, etc.

#### Key Files

- FinalProjectEDADataFrameCreationForModel - File to Create Personalized DataFrames
- FinalProjectEDA - File to create Visualizations of your data
- FinalProjectModel - Model that creates Models & Recommendations - Note hyperparameters may need to be manually adjusted for individual data
- FinalReport - Report created on the main findings of the project 
- ReadME.md - readme file for the project, within this file is a link to a video going through the entire project
- IMDB Model Data - Folder to place data files found in the link from the README file in the folder

#### Future Goals 

- Transform the project into an interactive website:
    - Allow users to input preferences such as genres, directors, or actors they want (or donâ€™t want) to be recommended.
    - Dynamically generate personalized movie recommendations based on user inputs.
- Integrate user feedback into the system:
    - Continuously refine recommendations over time.
    - Develop a self-improving platform through machine learning techniques.
